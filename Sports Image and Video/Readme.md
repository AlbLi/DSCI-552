This project utilized deep learning models, including ResNet40, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16 to classify 3747 images and 36+h videos
If possible, install and configure CUDA environemnt, which can significantly boost the performance, I used 3070ti and resulting in a 25X speedup
Cloud computing platforms like Google Colab is also recommended. However, be aware of the dataset size, which would exceed the normal Colab memory size
